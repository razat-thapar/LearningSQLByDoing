#---------------------------------------------------------------
# Demonstrating Read Committed Isolation level. 
# Read committed reads the latest committed data (i.e., persisted data only )
# PROS: 
# higher performacne than repeatable read level.
# No Dirty Reads 
# CONS: 
# Non-repeatable reads
## lower performance than read uncommitted level
# Use case: 
# Pre-requisites : 
# Download sakila, classicmodels databases.

SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; 

START TRANSACTION;

-- Read the customer name with id 1 
SELECT * 
FROM sakila.customer c 
WHERE c.customer_id='1'; 
-- execute the update customer first_name to xyz in another session but don't commit it. 
-- Read the customer name with id 1 again. 
SELECT * 
FROM sakila.customer c 
WHERE c.customer_id='1'; 
-- not able to see xyz but MARY(i.e., it's not doing DIRTY READ) 
-- Rollback the transaction in another session (i.e., session 2 )
-- Read the customer name with id 1 again. 
SELECT * 
FROM sakila.customer c 
WHERE c.customer_id='1'; 
-- works ! able to see MARY as first name only(it's reading persisted data. )
